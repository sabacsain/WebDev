        many fraudsters. Leaking the number may result in damage that can take a long time to repair

        to a legitimate and reputable company or individual.

        Understand carefully how the online sale or purchase process. Knowing how and where payments are made

        When buying using a credit card make sure that the other party is reputable and secure,
         make sure that the site’s URL starts with https, there is a locked padlock icon in the address bar,
        investigate the site’s TLS or SSL certificate issuer if it is both valid and up to date, use 
        an updated version of your browser, and lastly use escrow service if needed.
